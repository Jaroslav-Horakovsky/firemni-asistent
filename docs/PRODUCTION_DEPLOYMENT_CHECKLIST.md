```

**‚úÖ PASS CRITERIA:** Clean npm ci installation for all services

### **4. Database Connectivity (HIGH)**

## üîÑ DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

### **Stage 1: Branch Preparation**
```bash
# 1. Ensure on correct branch
git branch --show-current  # security-upgrade-systematic

# 2. Verify all changes committed
git status  # working tree clean

# 3. Final security validation
git log --oneline security-upgrade-backup..security-upgrade-systematic

# 4. Push final changes
git push origin security-upgrade-systematic
```

### **Stage 2: Staging Deployment (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging environment
git checkout staging
git merge security-upgrade-systematic
git push origin staging

# 2. Verify staging deployment
npm run health:staging  # if available
# OR manual verification of staging endpoints

# 3. Run smoke tests on staging
npm run test:smoke:staging  # if available
# OR manual verification of critical functionality
```

### **Stage 3: Production Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Merge to main branch
git checkout main
git merge security-upgrade-systematic

# 2. Tag the release
git tag -a security-upgrade-v1.0 -m "Security upgrade: SendGrid v8 + Secret Manager v6
- Eliminated 6 critical/high vulnerabilities
- Zero breaking changes
- Production ready deployment"

# 3. Push to production
git push origin main
git push origin security-upgrade-v1.0

# 4. Deploy services (adjust for your deployment process)
npm run deploy:production  # if available
# OR follow your specific deployment procedure
```

---

## üîç POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING

### **Immediate Verification (0-15 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Health check all services
curl -s https://production-api.domain.com/health
curl -s https://production-user.domain.com/health
curl -s https://production-customer.domain.com/health
curl -s https://production-order.domain.com/health

# 2. Verify package versions in production
# Check logs or admin endpoints for version confirmation

# 3. Test critical functionality
# - User authentication
# - Order creation
# - Email notifications
# - Database operations
```

### **Short-term Monitoring (15-60 minutes)**
```bash
# Monitor key metrics:
# - Response times (should be unchanged)
# - Error rates (should not increase)
# - Database connection health
# - Email delivery rates
# - Memory/CPU usage patterns
```

### **Extended Monitoring (1-24 hours)**
```bash
# Continue monitoring:
# - System stability
# - User experience metrics
# - Business process completion rates
# - Security alert systems
# - Performance baseline comparison
```

---

## üö® ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### **Quick Rollback (Emergency - < 5 minutes)**
```bash
# If immediate issues detected
git checkout main
git reset --hard security-upgrade-backup
git push origin main --force

# Redeploy previous version
npm run deploy:production  # or your deployment command
```

### **Service-Specific Rollback (< 15 minutes)**
```bash
# If only one service has issues
cd services/[affected-service]
git checkout security-upgrade-backup -- package.json package-lock.json
npm ci
# Restart affected service
```

### **Complete Environment Rollback (< 30 minutes)**
```bash
# Full system rollback
git checkout main
git reset --hard security-upgrade-backup
git push origin main --force

# Verify backup branch integrity
git branch -v | grep security-upgrade-backup

# Full redeployment of backup state
npm run install:all
npm run deploy:production
```
