   - User/Customer: coveralls → form-data <2.5.4 (2 CRITICAL - dev only)

✅ Upgrade Targets Confirmed:
   - @sendgrid/mail: ^7.7.0 → ^8.1.5+
   - @google-cloud/secret-manager: ^4.2.2 → ^6.1.0+
   - coveralls: Remove dev dependency

✅ Documentation Created:
   - File: VULNERABILITY_ANALYSIS.md
   - Content: Complete risk assessment + upgrade strategy
```

### **Phase 1.3: Testing Infrastructure Verification (✅ COMPLETE)**
```bash
✅ All Services Running & Healthy:
   - API Gateway (3000): ✅ Health OK
   - User Service (3001): ✅ Health OK, DB Connected, JWT Working
   - Customer Service (3002): ✅ Health OK, DB Connected, JWT Working  
   - Order Service (3003): ✅ Health OK, DB Connected, JWT Working

✅ Authentication Verified:
   - JWT enforcement working across all services
   - Token validation properly implemented
   - Security middleware functioning

✅ Database Connectivity:
   - PostgreSQL connections stable
   - Environment variable fallbacks working
   - Secret Manager graceful degradation
```

### **Phase 1.4: Staging Environment Discovery (✅ COMPLETE)**
```bash
✅ Staging Assessment:
   - Scripts exist: npm run health:staging
   - Environment: Currently not accessible (expected)
   - Strategy: Localhost testing during upgrades
   - Production scripts: Available for final deployment

✅ Testing Strategy Confirmed:
   - Development: localhost:3000-3003 (working)

## 🎯 **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

### **High-Priority Vulnerabilities (RELACE 20)**
```bash
🚨 API Gateway - @sendgrid/mail upgrade:
   - Current: v7.7.0 (vulnerable axios)
   - Target: v8.1.5+ (secure axios)
   - Impact: Email delivery system
   - Risk: Medium (breaking changes expected)
```

### **Critical-Priority Vulnerabilities (RELACE 21)**
```bash
🚨 Order Service - @google-cloud/secret-manager upgrade:
   - Current: v4.2.2 (vulnerable protobufjs)  
   - Target: v6.1.0+ (secure protobufjs)
   - Impact: Database credential access
   - Risk: High (major version, auth changes expected)
```

### **Low-Priority Issues (RELACE 22)**
```bash
⚠️ User/Customer Services - coveralls removal:
   - Current: coveralls@* (dev dependency)
   - Action: Remove package
   - Impact: Development testing only
   - Risk: Very Low
```
