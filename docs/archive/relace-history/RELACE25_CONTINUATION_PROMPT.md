# üîß RELACE 25: WSL RESTART RECOVERY + SERVICE AUTHENTICATION FIX

**Session Type:** CRITICAL ISSUE RECOVERY  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  
**Previous Issue:** WSL Integration failure ‚Üí Docker restart ‚Üí Authentication breakdown  
**Current Priority:** HIGH - All application services down due to missing Google Cloud credentials

---

## üö® CRITICAL SITUATION OVERVIEW

### **What Happened in Previous Session:**
1. **WSL Integration Error**: Docker Desktop reported WSL proxy failure
2. **WSL Restart Performed**: `wsl --shutdown` + restart to fix integration
3. **Docker Recovery**: Docker Engine successfully restored, all containers running
4. **Authentication Breakdown**: All services now failing with "Could not load the default credentials"
5. **Environment Reset**: WSL restart cleared all environment variables

### **Current System State:**
```bash
‚úÖ INFRASTRUCTURE: Docker fully operational, all containers running
‚ùå APPLICATIONS: Complete service outage - authentication failures
‚ùå ENVIRONMENT: Missing Google Cloud credentials + DATABASE_URL
üéØ IMMEDIATE NEED: Service restoration via database connection bypass
```

---

## üìã RELACE 25 OBJECTIVES

### **PRIMARY GOAL: Service Restoration (20 minutes)**
- Fix authentication by implementing DATABASE_URL bypass
- Get all 4 services responding to health checks
- Verify service-to-service communication working

### **SECONDARY GOAL: Environment Stabilization (10 minutes)**
- Complete Docker component updates (AI CLI + Scout CLI)
- Document working environment configuration
- Create WSL restart recovery procedure

### **STRETCH GOAL: Planning (remainder of time)**
- If services restored quickly, begin RELACE 24 planning (Inventory Service)
- Review ARCHITECTURE.md and business requirements

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **STEP 1: Database Credentials Discovery (5 min)**
```bash
# Find PostgreSQL container credentials
docker logs firemni-asistent-postgres-dev --tail 10

# Check environment or default credentials
# Likely: postgres/password or postgres/postgres
```

### **STEP 2: Environment Configuration (5 min)**
```bash
# Set direct database connection
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database]"

# Remove invalid Google Cloud credentials
unset GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

# Make permanent
echo 'export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[correct-credentials]"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'unset GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **STEP 3: Service Restart & Verification (5 min)**
```bash
# Restart all services with new environment
cd /home/horak/Projects/Firemn√≠_Asistent
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Verify health checks
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3001/health  
curl http://localhost:3002/health
curl http://localhost:3003/health
```

### **STEP 4: Docker Updates (5 min)**
```bash
# Complete Docker component updates
# In Docker Desktop: Update AI CLI v1.9.9 + Scout CLI v1.18.2
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Must Have (Critical)**
- [ ] All 4 services respond HTTP 200 to /health endpoints
- [ ] Database connections working (health checks pass)
- [ ] JWT authentication functional across services
- [ ] Environment variables persist after terminal restart

### **Should Have (Important)**  
- [ ] Docker component updates completed
- [ ] WSL integration stable (no error dialogs)
- [ ] Service logs show no authentication errors
- [ ] Working configuration documented

### **Nice to Have (If time permits)**
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md reviewed for Inventory Service planning
- [ ] Business requirements clarified for next implementation phase

## üìö CONTEXT FILES TO REVIEW

### **Priority Files (Read First)**
1. **WSL_DOCKER_ISSUE_2025_08_03.md** - Complete analysis of current issue
2. **DOCKER_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md** - Previous session context
3. **DOCKER_REPAIR_FINAL_STATUS.md** - Docker restoration background

### **Reference Files (If Needed)**
4. **SECURITY_UPGRADE_COMPLETE_REPORT.md** - Security upgrade context
5. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture for future planning
6. **RELACE24_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md** - Next phase planning

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **If DATABASE_URL Approach Fails:**
```bash
# Alternative 1: Check service configuration
# Look for secrets.js files in each service
# Verify environment variable priority

# Alternative 2: Temporary Google Cloud auth
gcloud auth application-default login

# Alternative 3: Service account creation
# Create service account via GCP console
# Download JSON and set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

### **If Docker Issues Persist:**
```bash
# Check Docker Desktop logs
# Verify WSL integration settings
# Consider full Docker Desktop restart
```

### **If Services Still Failing:**
```bash
# Check individual service logs
docker logs [service-name] --tail 20

# Verify database container accessible
docker exec -it firemni-asistent-postgres-dev psql -U [username]
```

## üìä PROJECT STATUS CONTEXT

### **Previous Achievements (RELACE 20-23)**
- ‚úÖ Security upgrade: 6 critical vulnerabilities ‚Üí 0 vulnerabilities  
- ‚úÖ Package updates: SendGrid v8, Secret Manager v6
- ‚úÖ All services tested and verified working
- ‚úÖ Production deployment preparation complete

### **Current Challenge**
- ‚ùå WSL restart broke Google Cloud authentication flow
- ‚ùå Services configured for production Secret Manager usage
- üéØ Need development environment bypass solution

### **Next Phase (Post-Recovery)**
- üöÄ RELACE 24: Inventory Service implementation
- ü§ñ AI integration planning and architecture
- üìà Advanced business features development

---

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **Before Starting Work:**
1. **Verify Current State**: Check if services already working (may have auto-recovered)
2. **Read Issue Analysis**: Complete understanding of WSL_DOCKER_ISSUE_2025_08_03.md
3. **Have Rollback Plan**: Know how to revert changes if approach fails

### **During Implementation:**
1. **One Change at a Time**: Test after each environment variable change
2. **Document Working Config**: Save successful DATABASE_URL pattern
3. **Verify Persistence**: Test that config survives terminal restart

### **Success Validation:**
1. **Health Checks**: All services must respond healthy
2. **Service Communication**: API Gateway ‚Üí downstream services working
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens working across service boundaries
