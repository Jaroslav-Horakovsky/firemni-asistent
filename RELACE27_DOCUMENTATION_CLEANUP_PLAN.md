## üìÇ PHASE 2: DOCUMENTATION REORGANIZATION

### **üóëÔ∏è FILES TO MOVE/DELETE:**

#### **‚Üí docs/archive/relace-history/**
```bash
mv RELACE23_FINAL_COMPLETION_REPORT.md docs/archive/relace-history/
mv RELACE24_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md docs/archive/relace-history/
mv RELACE25_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md docs/archive/relace-history/
```

#### **‚Üí docs/archive/troubleshooting/**
```bash
mv WSL_DOCKER_ISSUE_2025_08_03.md docs/archive/troubleshooting/
mv WSL_RESTART_RECOVERY_SOLUTION.md docs/archive/troubleshooting/
mv DOCKER_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md docs/archive/troubleshooting/
mv DOCKER_REPAIR_FINAL_STATUS.md docs/archive/troubleshooting/
```

#### **‚Üí docs/**
```bash
mv SECURITY_UPGRADE_COMPLETE_REPORT.md docs/
mv AI_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md docs/
mv PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md docs/
mv PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md docs/
mv PRODUCTION_TESTING_STRATEGY.md docs/
mv SERVER_STARTUP_GUIDE.md docs/
```

#### **üóëÔ∏è REVIEW FOR DELETION (check if obsolete):**
- `CREDENTIALS_LOCAL.md` - check if contains current credentials
- `DEVOPS.md` - check if still relevant vs newer docs
- `LOGGING.md` - check if superseded by newer practices
- `SCHEMA.md` - check if superseded by ARCHITECTURE.md
- `SECURITY.md` - check if superseded by SECURITY_UPGRADE_COMPLETE_REPORT.md

#### **‚úÖ KEEP IN ROOT (final structure):**
- `README.md` ‚≠ê main project documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚≠ê current system architecture  
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` ‚≠ê real-time project status
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` ‚≠ê implementation roadmap
- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` ‚≠ê documentation navigator
- `RELACE26_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` ‚≠ê current session context
- `RELACE27_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` ‚≠ê next session planning

## üß™ PHASE 3: COMPLETE PROJECT TESTING & ORIENTATION

### **üîç COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TESTING**

#### **1. Service Health Validation**
```bash
# Test all 4 services are operational
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # User Service  
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # Customer Service
curl http://localhost:3003/health  # Order Service

# Expected: All services healthy/degraded (degraded = correct for development)
```

#### **2. Database Connectivity Testing**
```bash
# Test Google Cloud connections work
PGPASSWORD=password psql -h 34.89.140.144 -U postgres -d user_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
PGPASSWORD=password psql -h 34.89.140.144 -U postgres -d customer_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;"  
PGPASSWORD=password psql -h 34.89.140.144 -U postgres -d order_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;"

# Document: Current data counts, table structures, relationships
```

#### **3. API Integration Testing**
```bash
# Test API Gateway routing
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers/health  
curl http://localhost:3000/api/orders/health

# Test authentication flow
# Test CRUD operations on each service
# Document: Working endpoints, authentication status, data flow
```

#### **4. Development Environment Validation**
```bash
# Test Docker containers
docker ps
docker logs firemni-asistent-api-gateway-dev
docker logs firemni-asistent-user-service-dev
docker logs firemni-asistent-customer-service-dev  
docker logs firemni-asistent-order-service-dev

# Test DATABASE_URL fallback mechanism
# Validate JWT authentication across services
```

### **üìä CREATE PROJECT ORIENTATION FILE**

#### **Create: `PROJECT_CURRENT_STATE_DETAILED.md`**
Document results of comprehensive testing:

```markdown
# PROJECT CURRENT STATE - DETAILED ANALYSIS

## Service Status Matrix
| Service | Port | Health | Database | JWT | API Routes | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|----------|-----|------------|-------|
| API Gateway | 3000 | ‚úÖ | N/A | ‚úÖ | X/Y working | Details |
| User Service | 3001 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | X/Y working | Details |
| Customer Service | 3002 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | X/Y working | Details |
| Order Service | 3003 | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | X/Y working | Details |

## Database Analysis  
- User DB: X users, full schema documented
- Customer DB: X customers, full schema documented
- Order DB: X orders, X items, full schema documented

## Integration Status
- Service-to-service communication: Status
- Authentication flow: Status  
- Business workflow: Status
- Missing pieces identified

## Development Environment
- Docker status: All containers healthy
- Database connections: All working via DATABASE_URL
- Secret Manager: Properly bypassed in development
- WSL integration: Stable

## Ready for Next Phase
- [x] Foundation services complete
- [x] Database relationships established  
- [x] Development environment stable
- [ ] Employee Service ready to implement
```

---

## üéØ PHASE 4: PROCEED WITH EMPLOYEE SERVICE

Only AFTER completing phases 1-3:

### **4.1 Employee Service Implementation**
- Create employee-service directory structure
- Implement employees database schema
- Create Employee CRUD API
- Integrate with User Service authentication
- Add Employee routes to API Gateway

### **4.2 Foundation for Project Management**
- Employee skills and rates management
- Employment type tracking (full-time, contractor, external)
- Department and position management
- Preparation for project assignments

---

## üìù CONTEXT FILES TO UPDATE

### **Update CLAUDE.md with:**
```markdown
## RELACE 27 MANDATORY SEQUENCE
1. **Documentation Cleanup** - Update root files BEFORE reorganization
2. **Complete Testing** - Full system validation and orientation
3. **Employee Service** - Only after cleanup and testing complete

## PROJECT STATE REQUIREMENTS  
- PROJECT_CURRENT_STATE_DETAILED.md must exist after testing
- All root documentation must be current before file moves
- Full service integration testing completed and documented
```

### **Create RELACE27_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md**
Complete context for session handoff with all phases detailed.

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR RELACE 27

- [ ] All root documentation updated and current
- [ ] Documentation reorganization completed 
- [ ] Complete system testing performed and documented
- [ ] PROJECT_CURRENT_STATE_DETAILED.md created
- [ ] Employee Service implementation started
- [ ] Clear foundation for Project Service in RELACE 28
